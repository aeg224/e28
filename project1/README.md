# Project 1

### By Alex Giannini

For project one, I created a Rock, Paper Scissors Game.

The app uses bootstrap for styling and includes two components.

### Component: <navigation-header>
This compenent encapsulates the bootstrap navbar and does not receive any arguments.

### Component: <game-feedback>
This component is used to display the results of the game. It receives two props, the user selection and the computer selection. It uses a computed property to determine the winner and display the data.
